Points to consider -
1. There is an upper limit and a lower limit to which an AI Paddle is allowed to move.
2. It reacts with some delay.
3. When the ball is close sometimes it guess incorrectly and moves inversly.

- For giving a limit we can provide a while loop and a paddle Y value condition
- We must know "how Y far the ball is" from paddle before we set any limit
    Create a function that tells in number how far in integer the ball is.
    (Recall Minus Y means up, plus Y means down)

    0 is min | VIRTUAL_HEIGHT is the max | = limit for Y

    VIRTUAL_HEIGHT / 2 - (ball_height / 2) is the center pos of ball

    MAX FAR : if travel > (VIRTUAL_HEIGHT / 2)   i.e. any distance longer than half of the screen
    NEAR : travel > ((VIRTUAL_HEIGHT / 2)/2)
    VERY NEAR : if both above conditions are false, the travel distance is way too small
